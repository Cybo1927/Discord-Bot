# Requirements for self-hosting:

### Install NodeJS and Discord.js:
Guide - https://discordjs.guide/preparations/

### If you already have NPM (installed with NodeJS):
* Create a folder for your bot (any name works)
* Open Console/CMD in the folders directory
* Paste `npm install discord.js fs dotenv` and press enter to install or update dependencies

### Setup:
* In the bot's directory create a file called .env
* Open .env in your favorite text/code editor
* Add the line `TOKEN = YOUR_TOKEN` and replace "YOUR_TOKEN" with your bot's specific token (this allows the bot to run)
